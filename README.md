Very much a W.I.P! This will eventually allow a simple way to search for a flag based on it's design.
Currently the ability to choose flag design parameters is finished as is the eventual posting of retrieved flags. Only three flags are included so far, just for testing purposes. (Those are easy to add anyways, so can be done last!)

Primary problem being worked on currently: Setting up an algorithm that takes the various states that are set to true and uses them to search the flag array for matching descriptors.

To test this app, type "npm start" into the terminal, as this was scaffolded with Create-React-App!
