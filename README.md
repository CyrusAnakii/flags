Very much a W.I.P! This will eventually allow a simple way to search for a flag based on it's design.
Currently the ability to choose flag design parameters is finished as is the eventual posting of retrieved flags. Just finished the ability to actually search flags by chosen parameters! So TECHNICALLY this works at a basic level! Only three flags are included so far, just for testing purposes. (Those are easy to add anyways, so can be done last!)

Primary problem being worked on currently: Cannot re-click the search for flags button due to not being able to re-post to DOM using the current render method. Root.Render has me smacking my head against a wall.

Other things that still need updating:  Add more flags. Redesign page aethestics.

To test this app, type "npm start" into the terminal, as this was scaffolded with Create-React-App!
