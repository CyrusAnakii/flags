This is a little helper for when you come across a flag that you can't identify, yet other flag finders don't seem to have in their systems either. This is because THIS flag finder is for flags that are no longer in use, as in their countries no longer exist! All you need to do is describe the flag using the two drop downs then click the search button and it will match your parameters to flags in the database, at which point it will display the matching flags at the bottom of the page. Each flag is clickable and will take you to the wikipedia page for that flag so you can learn more! There's also a reset button to reset all parameters. If no flags are found matching your description then a message will appear at the bottom instead explaining that no flags were found.

To Do List: At this point just add more flags!



To test this app, type "npm start" into the terminal, as this was scaffolded with Create-React-App!
