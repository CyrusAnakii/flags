It's ready! Needs better aethetics, but without someone with a better eye for art i'm at a disadvantage. Also needs more flags obviously, but the main parts are all up and running smoothly!

Primary problem being worked on currently: Come up with more possible things to add, otherwise work on adding flags / updating aethestics



To test this app, type "npm start" into the terminal, as this was scaffolded with Create-React-App!
